## 📌 Abstract

Traditional CAPTCHAs are increasingly vulnerable to AI-based bots and often frustrate genuine users.  
This project proposes a **passive verification system** that eliminates intrusive CAPTCHA puzzles.  

Using real-time **behavioral cues**—such as cursor movement, drag precision, and interaction time—the system classifies users with the help of **machine learning models** including:

- 🌲 **Random Forest**
- ⚡ **XGBoost**
- 🐈 **CatBoost**

The solution ensures fast, non-intrusive, and highly accurate verification—ideal for secure platforms like **Aadhaar authentication portals**.
